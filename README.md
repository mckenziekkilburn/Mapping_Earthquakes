# Mapping_Earthquakes
_____________________________________________
#### For this project we were asked to display Earthquake data on a map. Using Javascript, HTML, and CSS, we were able to do just that. After completing our first map, I decided that I would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and even would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and to see the data on a third map.

###### Here is a Image of the final product. we are showing the major earthquakes, tectonic plates' location, and filter to see all the earthquakes with a mag > than 4.5.
